    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Hi, I'm <b>Abdullah AL Maruf</b>, a passionate and self-motivated <b>Computer Science and Engineering</b> student at 
       <b>Daffodil International University (DIU)</b>. With a creative mindset and a love for problem-solving, I thrive in the fields of 
       <b>UI/UX design</b>, <b>web development</b>, and <b>digital marketing</b>. As an executive member of the 
       <b>Computer Programming Club</b> at DIU and a former student ambassador of the <b>IEEE Student Branch</b>, I actively engage 
       in tech communities and competitions, including <b>'Tech-Off'</b> and <b>'Unlock the Algorithm.'</b>
    </p> 

    <p>Beyond academics, I am the founder of <b>North Valley</b>, where I provide professional <b>graphic design services</b>, and the visionary behind 
       <b>North Mart</b>, an emerging e-commerce startup nearing completion. My expertise spans <b>logo & branding</b>, 
       <b>social media marketing</b>, <b>product design</b>, and <b>front-end development</b> using <b>JFrame</b>. I have also completed a 
       <b>Facebook marketing course</b> to strengthen my startup’s digital presence.
    </p> 

    <p>My journey is driven by curiosity and a relentless desire to learn. Whether it's designing seamless user interfaces, leading projects, 
       or mentoring peers, I always seek to make a meaningful impact. Outside of work and studies, I enjoy <b>gardening</b>, 
       <b>bike riding</b>, and <b>traveling with family and friends.</b>
    </p> 

    <p>With a dream to establish my own <b>IT firm</b>, I am continuously expanding my knowledge and skills to shape the future of technology. 
       Let’s connect and create something extraordinary together!
    </p>
